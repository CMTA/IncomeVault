Later you can update all the submodules with:

```
forge update
```

See also the command's [documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-update).



## Compilation

The official documentation is available in the Foundry [website](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/build-commands) 

```
 forge build --contracts src/RuleEngine.sol
```

```
 forge build --contracts src/RuleWhiteList.sol
```

## Testing

You can run the tests with

```
forge test
```

To run a specific test, use

```
forge test --match-contract <contract name> --match-test <function name>
```

See also the test framework's [official documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/tests), and that of the [test commands](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/test-commands).

### Coverage

* Perform a code coverage

```
forge coverage --ffi
```

* Generate LCOV report

```
forge coverage --report lcov
```

- Generate `index.html`

```bash
forge coverage --report lcov && genhtml lcov.info --branch-coverage --output-dir coverage
```
